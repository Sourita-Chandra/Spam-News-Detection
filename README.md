# Spam-News-Detection

Overview
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to classify news articles as true or fake. It leverages text preprocessing techniques like lemmatization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization to extract key features from the text.

 Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy
NLTK (Text Preprocessing)
Scikit-Learn (Naive Bayes, Train-Test Split, Accuracy Score)
XGBoost (Boosted Model for Performance Enhancement)
 Machine Learning Models Used
✔ Multinomial Naive Bayes
✔ XGBoost Classifier

 Performance Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
